				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>The Collaborative Workspace is a digital platform, developed by <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/" class="dotted-underline">Kingâ€™s Digital Lab</a>, that holds material digitised by the <a href="https://gpp.rct.uk/" class="dotted-underline">Royal Archives</a> as part of the <a href="https://georgianpapers.com/" class="dotted-underline">Georgian Papers Programme</a>. It is the one platform on which all datastreams for the Georgian papers, images, metadata and completed transcriptions, are offered; and will allow scholarly users to edit and augment these according to their own knowledge and close reading of the material.</p>
				<p>The platform is built to solicited requirements from both academics and information professionals and brings the rigour required by archivists through the implementation of archival standards (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/ead/EAD3taglib/index.html" class="dotted-underline">EAD3</a> and <a href="https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/schema/taglibrary/cpfTagLibrary2019_EN.html" class="dotted-underline">EAC-CPF</a>) while offering flexibility to scholars in allowing them to correct and augment almost all data surfaced in the Workspace. Editing is moderated to ensure fidelity.</p>
