						The Collaborative Workspace is a digital platform, developed by <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/">Kingâ€™s Digital Lab</a>, that holds material digitised by the <a href="https://gpp.rct.uk/">Royal Archives</a> as part of the Georgian Papers Programme. It is the one platform on which all datastreams for the Georgian papers, images, metadata and completed transcriptions, are offered; and will allow scholarly users to edit and augment these according to their own knowledge and close reading of the material.
					</p>
					<p class="home__article-para">
						The Collaborative Workspace is built to solicited requirements from both academics and information professionals and brings the rigour required by archivists through the implementation of archival standards (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/ead/EAD3taglib/index.html">EAD3</a> and <a href="https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/schema/taglibrary/cpfTagLibrary2019_EN.html">EAC-CPF</a>) while offering flexibility to scholars in allowing them to correct and augment almost all data surfaced in the Workspace. Editing is moderated to ensure fidelity.
